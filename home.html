        <strong>Mahathma.Gandhi,</strong> byname of <strong>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi,</strong> (born Oct. 2, 1869, Porbandar, India—died Jan. 30, 1948,
        Delhi), Preeminent leader of Indian nationalism and prophet of nonviolence in the 20th century.

        Gandhi grew up in a home steeped in religion, and he took for granted religious tolerance and the doctrine of
        ahimsa (noninjury to all living beings). He studied law in England from 1888 to 1891, and in 1893 he took a job
        with an Indian firm in South Africa. There he became an effective advocate for Indian rights.

        In 1906 he first put into action satyagraha, his technique of nonviolent resistance. His success in South Africa
        gave him an international reputation, and in 1915 he returned to India and within a few years became the leader
        of a nationwide struggle for Indian home rule. By 1920 Gandhi commanded influence hitherto unattained by any
        political leader in India.

        He refashioned the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/summary/Indian-National-Congress" font-weight="bold">Indian National Congress </a>into an effective political instrument of Indian nationalism and
        undertook major campaigns of nonviolent resistance in 1920–22, 1930–34 (including his momentous march to the sea
        to collect salt to protest a government monopoly), and 1940–42. In the 1930s he also campaigned to end
        discrimination against India’s lower-caste “untouchables” (Dalits; officially designated as Scheduled Castes)
        and concentrated on educating rural India and promoting cottage industry.</div>
